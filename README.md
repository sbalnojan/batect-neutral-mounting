# Batect Neutral Mounting

[batect](http://batect.dev) is a tool I love because it makes things so much easier.
One thing that is though still not totally figured out is operating system independence.

Since _batect_ mostly wraps docker, it still carries OS-dependent syntax in a few places.

Here is how I handle that to provide a truly OS-independent experience.

```
$ ./batect --list-tasks
